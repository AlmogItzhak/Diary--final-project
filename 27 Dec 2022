Today we went over last week's tasks.

Tasks for next week:
The next step is starting the review of the literature- read about “Imbalanced”.
Find good academic articles about Imbalanced - explore and read them. (If those articles link to other relevant articles - read them as well)
Start with some background- with classic articles and then the newest and innovative articles.
When I find a good article- send it to you (Michael and Noa) and show the logics- what the articles talk about and the reference to another article.
That will help me mapping approaches and mapping the issue of imbalance.
