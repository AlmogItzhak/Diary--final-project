We talked about:
Today we went through the files in which I wrote the names of the articles that present a way of dealing with the problems that the previous articles talked about and a brief explanation about the ways of dealing with the problems that are explained in each article.

Tasks for next week:
We will choose 3 problems and 3 leading articles that seem most relevant.
Chosen according to how innovative, current, leading in the ranking they are.
In addition, the article will be chosen based on dealing with a main problem in imbalanced datasets, and that the authors provide a code/github link/pseudo code that is good enough to work with.
